	    	<h1>Habits Tracker</h1>
        	<p>Welcome to your daily habit tracker app! Created by Tamis, Q, and Brad. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Just a little indication. You can do it. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? All kinds of happy little splashes. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.</p>
